Signature Verification Summary

Bob decrypted the file signed_message.asc using his private key. During the
decrypt/verify operation, GPG confirmed the validity of Alice’s digital
signature.

Kleopatra displayed the message:

    "Valid signature by alice@example.com"

This verifies the following:

1. The message was signed using Alice’s private key.
2. The signature matches Alice’s public key (public.asc), proving Alice is the sender.
3. The message has not been modified after signing (integrity is guaranteed).
4. Only Bob was able to decrypt the file using his private key, ensuring confidentiality.

The operation demonstrates:
- Authentication (only Alice could create the signature)
- Integrity (message unchanged)
- Confidentiality (encrypted only for Bob)
